# World Height Resetter
A datapack which resets the world height limit back to 0-256 for Minecraft 1.18+

This is a fork of https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/world-height-resetter-0-256/ which makes it work on 1.18.2+

**NOTE:** Versions 1.18 and 1.18.1 still need the original pack to work.
